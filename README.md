# pgen
A PEG tokenizer/parser-generator.

This is the program that generates the tokenizer and parser for the [Daisho](https://github.com/apaz-cli/Daisho)
programming language. Right now, it's a WIP. The project is not usable.

The syntax of pgen is based on the paper ["Parsing Expression Grammars: A Recognition-Based Syntactic Foundation"](https://bford.info/pub/lang/peg.pdf)
by [Bryan Ford](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=TwyzQP4AAAAJ).
This specific parser is inspired by [packcc](https://github.com/arithy/packcc) by [Arihiro Yoshida](https://github.com/arithy).
However, its purpose is completely different.

The one difference is that peg grammars like the ones you would
write for `packcc` operate on individual characters of the input. For
`pgen`, you define both a tokenizer and a parser. The tokenizer
recognizes and groups together sequences of characters into tokens.
It uses the [maximal munch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximal_munch)
heuristic and throws an error if there are ambiguities. Then the parser
strings together the token stream coming from the tokenizer into an
[abstract syntax tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree).

Unlike other parser-generators such as `yacc` or `packcc`, `pgen` doesn't
hide the fact that it's a virtual machine, and arguably its own
programming language. Embracing this fact opens up the ability to
effortlessly generate Abstract Syntax Trees.

## License

The license for `pgen` is GPLv3. The license applies only to the files already in this repository (other
than `packcc.c` and `packcc`). The license for the code generated by `pgen` is the license of the grammar
that it was generated from. For example, since the parser for `pgen` is itself generated from `pgen.peg`
which is GPLv3, the resulting `pgen.h` from running `pgen pgen.peg` is also GPLv3. If `pgen.peg` were MIT
licensed, then `pgen.h` would be MIT licensed as well. If you write a grammar, you own the code that
`pgen` generates from it. But if you modify `pgen` itself and distribute it, it has to be released under
GPLv3.
